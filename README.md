[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/asteffey/fcc-markdown-previewer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/asteffey/fcc-markdown-previewer)

The site is hosted at https://asteffey.github.io/fcc-markdown-previewer.  
Alternatively, it can be viewed with the [freeCodeCamp test suite](https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/testable-projects-fcc/v1/bundle.js) 
by appending [`?fcc-test`](https://asteffey.github.io/fcc-markdown-previewer?fcc-test) to the URL.

This is a [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) project which uses React and Redux to create a Markdown Previewer. 
Additionally, this project also demonstrates the use of Bootstrap Styled, ESLint, and a basic CI/CD pipeline using Travis with deployment to GitHub pages.
